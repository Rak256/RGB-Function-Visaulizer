# RGB-Function-Visaulizer
A Windows API program that represents mathematical functions as RGB colors

This program utilizes bitmap coloring and row-column manipulation of pixels to create a beautiful representation of an input mathematical expression. 

THE USER MUST INPUT A VALUE IN THIS SPECIFIC ORDER WHEN PROMPTED. THESE ARE ALTERNATING INPUTS STARTING WITH THE FIRST INPUT:
1) OPERATOR - "+" for addition, "-" for subtraction, "*" for multiplication, "/" for division
2) NUMERIC VALUE OR SPECIAL CHARACTERS - "x" for x coordinate and "y" for y coordinate.

Once the expression has been entered, simply close the input prompt window to view the representation. Close the new window to exit the program.
